This website is part of my final project for my web development course.  
I built it using **Hugo** and the **Ananke theme**, and I’m hosting it on **Netlify**.  
The goal of the project is to show that I can structure a complete website, organize content, and customize both layout and design.

On this site you’ll find:

- A short **About** page  
- Several **Articles** I wrote  
- A small **Blog** with a few updates  
- A customized layout and background image  

Everything here is meant to feel clean, simple, and easy to navigate.  
I wanted to make something that feels like *my own style* while still meeting all the requirements for the assignment.
