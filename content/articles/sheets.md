## Teachers & Helpful Resources

Here are a few teachers and communities that have solid, practical guidance for anyone wanting to go deeper into their yoga practice:

- **Andrew Eppler** – My main teacher and someone who breaks things down in a very real, understandable way.

- **David Swenson** – One of the early American Ashtanga practitioners. He still travels and teaches workshops with a very welcoming style.  
  <a href="https://www.ashtanga.net/" target="_blank">His website →</a>

- **Tim Miller** – A longtime, respected teacher whose approach shaped a lot of today’s Ashtanga community. He appears to be retired now, but his influence is still everywhere.

- **Ashtanga Yoga Club Durham** – A warm, community-focused shala originally led by Suzanne Faulkner, who was deeply loved in the Ashtanga world. It’s now carried on by Joanna Darlington, another strong and thoughtful teacher.

  Joanna’s page: <a href="https://joannadarlington.com/" target="_blank">joannadarlington.com</a>  
  Both of them studied with **David Garrigues**, whose teaching blends Ashtanga with alignment awareness in a way that’s super helpful for newer students.
