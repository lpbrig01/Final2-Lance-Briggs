## Who I Am

I’m Lance Briggs — a college student, runner, tech guy, and someone who’s constantly trying to level up.  
I built this website as part of my final project for my web development class, but I wanted it to feel like **me**, not just another template.

I'm majoring in IT, learning more every day about coding, networks, cybersecurity, and how technology can actually solve real-world problems.

Outside of class, I stay busy with **track**, **fitness**, and ongoing projects that push me to grow.

## Why I Built This Site

This site is a way to show that I understand:

- How to structure a full website using Hugo  
- How themes, templates, and content systems work  
- How to update layouts and customize pages  
- How to deploy a static site using Netlify  

Basically, it’s a mix of creativity and technical skill — and honestly, it taught me more than I expected.

## What I’m Working Toward

I’m always trying to get better at what I do — whether it's improving my form on the track, learning a new programming concept, or building something that didn't exist before.

I’m aiming for a career somewhere in **IT, cybersecurity, or software**, and everything I build now (even small projects like this) is a step in that direction.

## A Final Note

Thanks for checking out the site.  
It’s simple, but it represents real effort — late nights fixing code, breaking things, rebuilding them, and making sure everything finally works the way it should.

More projects coming soon.
